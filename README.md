### Description

Following a number of requests for information, suggestions for improvements

I have spent some time updating this little application with some improved functionality.

It is still primarily a little tutorial on the useful nature of the FileSystemObject wrapped

up in the scrrun.dll, with some useful content on the nature of a class: setting, getting

and populatinf attributes. Now includes some useful interface guidance on menu setting

option buttons and ListView control handling.

- File information is now viewed in a resizable ListView control

- The ListView Control supports multiple views

- Columns in the ListView can be sorted by clicking on the columnheader

- Columns in the ListView can dragged to change order
 
### More Info
 
Not Applicable

Your PC should have scrrun.dll installed and registered.
