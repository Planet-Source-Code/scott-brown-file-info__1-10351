Following a number of requests for information, suggestions for improvements
I have spent some time updating this little application with some improved functionality.

It is still primarily a little tutorial on the useful nature of the FileSystemObject wrapped 
up in the scrrun.dll, with some useful content on the nature of a class: setting, getting
and populatinf attributes. Now includes some useful interface guidance on menu setting
option buttons and ListView control handling.

- File information is now viewed in a resizable ListView control
- The ListView Control supports multiple views
- Columns in the ListView can be sorted by clicking on the columnheader
- Columns in the ListView can dragged to change order
